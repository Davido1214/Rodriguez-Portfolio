                My name is <span>David Rodriguez</span> I am an upcoming developer. My current top project is the Run Buddy webpage. I am currently based in Phoenix while learning and practicing html/css/js and more in the near future. My goal in the next 6 months is to prepare myself for a full time job in the field working as a back-end developer or a fullstack developer.
